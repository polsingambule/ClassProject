				<h2>&#9193; Studying medical science.</h2>
				<p>&#128073; A qualification in Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology is a prerequisite for many courses which lead to professional qualifications in alternative or complementary medicine. Our distance learning courses, which are available via correspondence and online, have been designed to supplement learning for those wishing to progress to the study of natural health therapies. Whether you are studying to be a nutritionist, homeopath or a yoga instructor, our courses will provide a high level of knowledge in medical science required for these practices.</p>

				<h2>&#9193; Education for Medical Scientists.</h2>
				<p>&#128073; Students planning careers as medical scientists generally pursue a bachelor's degree in biology, chemistry, or a related field. Undergraduate students benefit from taking a broad range of classes, including life sciences, physical sciences, and math. Students also typically take courses that develop communication and writing skills, because they must learn to write grants effectively and publish their research findings.</p>

				<h2>&#9193; Medical Scientist Training.</h2>
				<p>&#128073; Medical scientists often begin their careers in temporary postdoctoral research positions or in medical residency. During their postdoctoral appointments, they work with experienced scientists as they continue to learn about their specialties or develop a broader understanding of related areas of research. Graduates of M.D. or D.O. programs may enter a residency program in their specialty of interest. A residency usually takes place in a hospital and varies in duration, generally lasting from 3 to 7 years, depending on the specialty. Some fellowships exist that train medical practitioners in research skills. These may take place before or after residency.</p>

				<h2>&#9193; About Medical Sciences.</h2>
				<p>&#128073; Medical Sciences (ISSN 2076-3271) is an international open access scientific journal, providing a platform for advances in basic, translational and clinical research. The journal aims to publish original research, review articles and short communications about molecular and cellular processes in disease, in order to increase understanding of the fundamental principles and biological questions of medicine. Researchers in academic and clinical settings as well as health professionals are encouraged to publish their theoretical and experimental results in this journal, which aims to integrate expertise from the molecular and translational sciences, therapeutics, and diagnostics in different medical specialties.</p>
